Current TODO List

[ ] - not done
[>] - in progress
[x] - complete

Soon
=======================================
[ ] - Move onConnect hook to right before sending registration stuff,
		to allow for neater things when connecting.
[ ] - Allow the on*Out() hooks to modify the message being sent.
[ ] - prefix/status mode storage: use something ordered rather than an
		unordered_map
[ ] - supports map for better support lookup.  probably like this:
		std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string> >
		where key = service and value = vector of names of supporting modules
