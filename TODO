RoBoBo-IRC-BoBo
Current TODO List

[ ] - not done
[>] - in progress
[x] - complete

Before release.  Duh.
=======================================
[x] - Rename ModuleInterface to Base or something
[x] - Destroy the word "get"
[>] - Protocol modules!
	[x] - Move Socket class
	[x] - Move most of current connection stuff to p_client
	[ ] - Protocol modules for current versions of popular IRCds
		[ ] - InspIRCd
		[ ] - Unreal 4 if/when it's ever released
		[ ] - maybe others?
	[ ] - Use long-name modes with mode function; protocol modules translate long modes into letters if necessary
		[ ] - Protocol modules
			[>] - p_client - defaults with configurable changes
		[ ] - Module API
[>] - Modular sockets: allow protocol modules to pick a socket class to use
	[ ] - allows more than just plaintext, e.g. SSL without stunnel, etc.
[x] - Change how users are handled (p_client)
	[x] - Server has channels and users
[ ] - Provide a per-server option to bypass core flood control (clients only--servers don't need flood control)
[ ] - Change module API to adjust, of course
	[ ] - Server functions and client versions
[ ] - Store bot's user modes and allow modules to check them
[ ] - Prioritize receiving through module-defined receive priority (default normal, others high, low, maybe intermediates for both?)
[ ] - Allow blocking of receive messages
	[ ] - m_ignore
[ ] - Get rid of PROTOCTL NAMESX and just use CAP multi-prefix from 1.1
[ ] - Use CAP userhost-in-names where possible rather than WHO
	[ ] - Include the userhost-in-names CAP capability in m_cap as part of the core (like multi-prefix)
	[x] - Delegate the call to WHO to the NAMES processor in case the server doesn't support userhost-in-names
	[ ] - Consider whether to keep the WHOIS command sent on connect to get the bot's ident and host
[ ] - User status class for each server
	[ ] - keep status order
	[ ] - overloaded operators for comparisons
[ ] - Configuration: remove the need for users to type the m_ prefix and the .so extension
	[ ] - detects whether it's a normal module (for module blocks) or a protocol module (var in server blocks) by the prefix (m_ vs. p_)
[ ] - Give modules a way to the robobo dir so that incorrect assumptions aren't made regarding people using dir/robobo instead of cd dir; ./robobo
