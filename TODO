Current TODO List

[ ] - not done
[>] - in progress
[x] - complete

Before release.  Duh.
=======================================
[x] - Move onConnect hook to right before sending registration stuff,
		to allow for neater things when connecting.
[x] - Allow the on*Out() hooks to modify the message being sent.
[x] - prefix/status mode storage: use something ordered rather than an
		unordered_map
[>] - supports map for better support lookup.  probably like this:
		std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string> >
		where key = service and value = vector of names of supporting modules
[ ] - Pretty much everything else here requires some sort of update to MODULES.
		An occasional update to docs would be nice.
[x] - Use WHO and store user hosts in the bot as well
[ ] - Implement CAP (m_cap) with some sort of interface
