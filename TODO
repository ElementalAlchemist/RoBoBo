Current TODO List

[ ] - not done
[>] - in progress
[x] - complete

Alpha 1
=======================================
[x] - Move onConnect hook to right before sending registration stuff,
		to allow for neater things when connecting.
[x] - Allow the onOut() hooks to modify the message being sent.
[x] - prefix/status mode storage: use something ordered rather than an
		unordered_map
[x] - supports map for better support lookup.  probably like this:
		std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string> >
		where key = service and value = vector of names of supporting modules
[x] - Pretty much everything else here requires some sort of update to MODULES.
		An occasional update to docs would be nice.
[x] - Use WHO and store user hosts in the bot as well
[x] - Implement CAP (m_cap) with some sort of interface
[x] - Port all the modules to API version 1.1
[x] - Make removing servers actually remove the server
[x] - Keep track of own ident and host, and add line breaker

Beta 1
=======================================
[x] - Update example conf with new modules
[x] - Allow modules to be loaded without conf, and have modules that require a
		conf check that it exists
[ ] - Add a function which returns a version of a string stripped of bold,
		underline, and color characters

Stable Release
=======================================
[>] - Keep the Current API section of MODULES updated through release
