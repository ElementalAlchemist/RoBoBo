RoBoBo-IRC-BoBo
Current TODO List

[ ] - not done
[>] - in progress
[x] - complete

2.0 Alpha 1
=======================================
[x] - Rename ModuleInterface to Base or something
[x] - Destroy the word "get"
[x] - Protocol modules!
	[x] - Move Socket class
	[x] - Move most of current connection stuff to p_client
	[x] - Protocol modules for current versions of popular IRCds
		[x] - InspIRCd
	[x] - Use long-name modes with mode function; protocol modules translate long modes into letters if necessary
		[x] - Protocol modules
			[x] - p_client
			[x] - allow configurable changes
		[x] - Module API
[x] - Modular sockets: allow protocol modules to pick a socket class to use
[x] - Change how users are handled (p_client)
	[x] - Server has channels and users
[x] - Provide a per-server option to bypass core flood control (clients only--servers don't need flood control)
[x] - Change module API to adjust, of course
[x] - Store bot's user modes and allow modules to check them
[x] - Prioritize receiving through module-defined receive priority (default normal, others high, low, maybe intermediates for both?)
[x] - Allow blocking of receive messages
	[x] - m_ignore
[x] - Get rid of PROTOCTL NAMESX and just use CAP multi-prefix from 1.1
[x] - Use CAP userhost-in-names where possible rather than WHO
	[x] - Include the userhost-in-names CAP capability in m_cap as part of the core (like multi-prefix)
	[x] - Delegate the call to WHO to the NAMES processor in case the server doesn't support userhost-in-names
	[x] - Consider whether to keep the WHOIS command sent on connect to get the bot's ident and host
[x] - User status comparison
[x] - Configuration: remove the need for users to type the m_ prefix and the .so extension
	[x] - detects whether it's a normal module (for module blocks) or a protocol module (var in server blocks) by the prefix (m_ vs. p_)
[x] - Give modules a way to the robobo dir so that incorrect assumptions aren't made regarding people using dir/robobo instead of cd dir; ./robobo
[x] - Refactor sending hooks to make non-client protocols compatible with module API (i.e. FMODE, etc. for InspIRCd going to onOther instead of onMode)
	[x] - Hide base from direct protocol module access
	[x] - protocol
	[x] - base
	[x] - p_client
	[x] - p_inspircd21
[x] - Make sure all modules follow updated API
[x] - Update example conf

2.0 Beta 1
=======================================
[x] - Documentation updates
	[x] - PROTOCOL
	[x] - MODULES
	[x] - README
[x] - Enhance bot control admin modules (say, channels, etc.) with the ability to choose a client on that server
	[x] - Possibly include client list in all of these, or individual m_admin_clientlist?

2.0 Beta 2
=======================================
[x] - Make the InspIRCd module handle x:lines; currently, they are not received or stored properly
[ ] - Add longmode mode to client module for proper handling of such a thing

???
=======================================
[ ] - SSL socket module
