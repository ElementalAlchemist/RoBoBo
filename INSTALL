RoBoBo is quite simple to install; installation is as simple as a slight
variation of the traditional "./configure; make; make install" installation
process.

1. make: This builds the configure script.  You only need to do this once ever,
unless you delete the entire project.  If you accidentally delete the configure
binary file later but need it again, you can rebuild it from the robobo main
directory:
g++ src/configure -o configure

2. ./configure: This finds the module source files and puts the correct
Makefiles together.  This overwrites the Makefile that builds the configure
script, so make sure that once you do this you don't delete the configure
binary unless you have access to the original Makefile or know how to build it
from command line.

3. make: Now that the Makefile is different, this command will build the bot.

Before you run the bot, you need to copy the file robobo.conf.example to
robobo.conf and edit it completely.  You only need to do this once, unless you
delete the robobo.conf file.

After this, you can simply run the bot with the command ./robobo.
