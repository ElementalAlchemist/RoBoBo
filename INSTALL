This bot is in VERY EARLY construction and is not recommended for any use other
than development.  A simple compile.sh script has been provided for easy
compiling until the bot advances enough to justify the creation of a makefile
etc.  The compile script requires g++.
If you wish to compile the bot with debug symbols for debugging, simply run the
compile script with "debug" as an argument, i.e.

./compile.sh debug

The use of any other or no arguments will cause the bot to be compiled
normally.
