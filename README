=======================
1. THE BASICS

Thank you for using RoBoBo!  What is here is just the bot's core.  It will
connect to an IRC server, but it won't do much more than just idle.  A few
modules are provided to do things that ship in the core of most bots (DCC chat,
admin commands, etc.).  The distribution modules can also provide good examples
for how to do certain things with modules.
If you want your bot to do something interesting, you can create your own
modules (see section 5 below) or look for modules others have created.  We have
a place designated for uploading and support for modules, located at
http://s1.zetaboards.com/robobo/forum/1360960/
To install new modules after you've installed the bot, simply run ./configure
and make again.

=======================
2. CONFIGURING

See the CONFIGURING file for help with modifying robobo.conf and using multiple
configuration files.

=======================
3. INSTALLING

See the INSTALL file for information.

=======================
4. LICENSE

RoBoBo is licensed under the MIT License.
For this license and related information see the LICENSE file.

5. CREATING MODULES

Creating modules requires a knowledge of C++.  If you don't know it, Google can
help you find a good tutorial.
For the specifics on creating modules, see the MODULES file.  The MODULES file
assumes you have a basic grasp of C++ and jumps right into what you need to
know just for this bot.
For the specifics on creating protocol modules, see the PROTOCOL file.  The
same disclaimer above for the MODULES file applies here.
For the specifics on creating socket modules, see the SOCKET file.  This file
expects at least basic knowledge of socket programming in C/C++.

6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank MasseR from GitHub for somehow finding this project at
the very beginning and giving me a needed push in the right direction. :)
Thanks also to him for knowing more about makefiles than me.
