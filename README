3. CREATING MODULES

Creating modules requires a knowledge of C++.  If you don't know it, Google can
help you find a good tutorial.
For the specifics on creating modules, see the MODULES file.  The MODULES file
assumes you already know at least some C++ and jumps right into what you need
to know just for this bot.

4. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank MasseR from GitHub for somehow finding this project at
the very beginning and giving me a needed push in the right direction. :)
Thanks also to him for knowing more about makefiles than me.

I would also like to thank the InspIRCd project.  This isn't particularly
because they are so awesome (even though they are).  RoBoBo's flood protection
system is based on the idea of their penalty system, documented in their wiki
somewhere.
