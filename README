===================
1. USING THE BOT

Contained here is simply the bot's core.  The core of the bot does very little
other than idle in a channel.  It's likely if you have this bot that you want
it to do stuff.  In order to do this, you will need to load modules.

The bot comes with some modules to do basic things that ship in the core of
most bots (admin interface, DCC chat, etc.), but beyond these basics, you will
have to find other modules.

You can find more modules to do things by visiting our forum for user-created
modules, located at http://s1.zetaboards.com/robobo/forum/1360960/
If you'd like, you can also create your own modules.  See our wiki at
https://github.com/ElementalAlchemist/RoBoBo/wiki for more information on that.

If you have questions about configuring the bot, running modules, or creating
modules, most questions should be answerable based on information contained in
the support wiki (https://github.com/ElementalAlchemist/RoBoBo/wiki).  If your,
questions remain unanswered, feel free to ask on our IRC channel
(irc://irc.chatspike.net/robobo) or on our forums
(http://s1.zetaboards.com/robobo).

2. REPORTING BUGS

If you found a bug, we would love to hear about it.  Look for an existing
report on the bug tracker
(https://github.com/ElementalAlchemist/RoBoBo/issues), and, if it's not already
there, open a new report describing the issue in as much detail as possible.
In order to get as much information as you can, you should compile the bot with
debug flags (make debug) and reproduce the bug in this setup.
