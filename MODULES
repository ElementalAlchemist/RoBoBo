=======================
1. CONSTRUCTORS

You should at least initialize variables you create, as with any good C++ code.
Your constructor should inherit the Module class and its constructor:

class m_samplemodule : public Module

m_samplemodule::m_samplemodule(/*Something will go in here when I code that far*/) : Module (/*This will, also*/)

The unordered_map channels is saved to a provided variable, and the botSocket
is used in functions provided by the base class allowing you to send messages,
etc.
The botSocket is used internally.

=======================
2. PROVIDED VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS

A pointer is inherited by modules which points to the list of channels and
their information.  channelList points to an unordered_map of channels.  The
channel data is held in the data, and the map keys hold the channel names.

A function is also inherited by modules.  This function will split a string
into words by spaces and return std::vector<std::string> containing all the
words in the order they were in the string.  This function is called like this:
splitLine = splitBySpace(line);
Where splitLine and line can be replaced with any variable names, as long as
splitLine is of the type std::vector<std::string> and line is an std::string.

An empty function is declared in the base class for reading config variables:
config(std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> configVars)
You can then read your variables in with this function.  The parameter, an
unordered map, holds the name of the variable specified in the configuration
as the key, and variable's data in the configuration as the value.

=======================
3. HOOKS AND PARAMETERS

Below is a list of IRC hooks provided by the base class and called in the bot's
code.  Each is followed by the list of parameters with the type of each
parameter, and it is laid out in a multi-line format: the first line contains
the function call, and the rest, contained in a multi-line comment block,
contain a description of the function's purpose.

onChannelMsg(std::string channel, char target, std::string nick, std::string message)
/* Allows you to do something when the bot receives a channel message.  This
function is not called when a CTCP is sent to the channel.  See onChannelCTCP.
The channel parameter holds the channel's name.  The target parameter holds the
status character that the user must have to receive the message
(e.g. /msg @#channel blah).  If the message is sent to the entire channel the
target parameter will hold the character '0' (the number zero).  The nick
parameter holds the nick of the user who sent the message.  The message
parameter holds the contents of the message sent to the channel. */

onUserMsg(std::string nick, std::string message)

The message parameter holds the contents of the message sent. */

onChannelNotice(std::string channel, char target, std::string nick, std::string message)
/* Allows you to do something when the bot receives a channel notice.  This
function is not called when a CTCP reply is sent to the channel.
See onChannelCTCPReply.
The channel parameter holds the channel's name.  The target parameter holds the
status character that the user must have to receive the message
(e.g. /notice @#channel blah).  If the message is sent to the entire channel
the target parameter will hold the character '0' (the number zero).  The nick
parameter holds the nick of the user who sent the message.  The message
parameter holds the contents of the message sent. */

onUserNotice(std::string nick, std::string message)
/* Allows you to do something when a notice is sent to the bot.  This function
is not called when a CTCP reply is sent to the bot.  See onUserCTCPReply.
The nick parameter holds the nick of the user who sent the notice.
The message parameter holds the contents of the message sent. */

onChannelCTCP(std::string channel, std::string nick, std::string type, std::string params)
/* Allows you to do something when the bot receives a CTCP request sent to a
channel.  The channel parameter holds the name of the channel the CTCP was sent
to.  The nick parameter holds the nick of the user who sent the CTCP.  The type
parameter holds the CTCP command (the first word, i.e. PING, VERSION, etc.).
The params parameter holds any data sent after the CTCP command before the end
character. */

onUserCTCP(std::string nick, std::string type, std::string params)
/* Allows you to do something when the bot receives a CTCP request sent to it.
The nick parameter holds the nick of the user who sent the CTCP.  The type
parameter holds the CTCP command (the first word, i.e. PING, VERSION, etc.).
The params parameter holds any data sent after the CTCP command before the end
character. */

onChannelCTCPReply(std::string channel, std::string nick, std::string type, std::string data)
/* Allows you to do something when the bot receives a CTCP reply sent to a
channel.  The channel parameter holds the name of the channel it was sent to.
The nick parameter holds the nick of the user who sent the CTCP reply.
The type parameter holds the CTCP command being replied to (the first word,
i.e. PING, VERSION, etc.).  The data parameter holds the data sent with the
CTCP reply before the ending CTCP character. */

onUserCTCPReply(std::string nick, std::string type, std::string data)
/* Allows you to do something when the bot receives a CTCP reply sent to it.
The nick parameter holds the nick of the user who sent the CTCP reply.
The type parameter holds the CTCP command being replied to (the first word,
i.e. PING, VERSION, etc.).  The data parameter holds the data sent with the
CTCP reply before the ending CTCP character. */

onChannelJoin(std::string channel, std::string hostmask)
/* Allows you to do something when a user joins a channel that the bot is in.
The channel parameter holds the name of the channel.  The hostmask parameter
holds the hostmask (in nick!user@host format) of the user who joined the
channel. */

onChannelPart(std::string channel, std::string hostmask, std::string reason)
/* Allows you to do something when a user parts a channel that the bot is in.
The channel parameter holds the name of the channel that the user parted from.
The hostmask parameter holds the hostmask of the user who parted.  The reason
parameter holds the part reason given. */

onUserQuit(std::string hostmask, std::string reason)
/* Allows you to do something when a user quits.  The hostmask parameter holds
the hostmask of the user who quit.  The reason parameter holds the quit reason
given. */

onChannelKick(std::string channel, std::string kicker, std::string kickee, std::string reason)
/* Allows you to do something when someone is kicked.  The channel parameter
holds the name of the channel in which the kick occurred.  The kicker parameter
holds the hostmask of the user who kicked someone.  The kickee parameter holds
the nick of the user who was kicked.  The reason parameter holds the kick

onOutMessage(std::string target, std::string& message)
/* Allows you to do something just before the bot sends out a message.
The target parameter holds the target (either nick or channel) of the message.
The message parameter holds the contents of the message to be sent.  The
message is passed by reference so that it can be modified before it is sent. */

onOutNotice(std::string target, std::string& message)
/* Allows you to do something just before the bot sends out a notice.
The target parameter holds the target (either nick or channel) of the notice.
The message parameter holds the contents of the message to be sent.  The
message is passed by reference so that it can be modified before it is sent. */

4. MODULE FUNCTIONS

This is a list of functions you can use to perform actions on IRC.  The list is
formatted the same way as the hooks list, above.  These functions are
predefined for you to use.

sendPrivMsg(std::string target, std::string message)
// Sends a PRIVMSG to target (nick or channel) with the message provided.

sendNotice(std::string target, std::string message)
// Sends a NOTICE to target (nick or channel) with the message provided.

sendCTCP(std::string target, std::string type, std::string params)
/* Sends a CTCP request to target (nick or channel).  It has a type (PING,
VERSION, etc.) and potentially parameters given as params.  The params
parameter is optional. */

sendCTCPReply(std::string target, std::string type, std::string data)
/* Sends a CTCP reply to target (nick or channel).  It has a type (PING,
