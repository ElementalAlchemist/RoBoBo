=======================
1. CURRENT API

The current API version is 2.0.0.

int ModuleClass::botAPIversion() {
	return 2000;
}

Module-breaking changes to the API are avoided starting with the release
candidate.  The API version in use as of 2.0.0RC1 was 2.0.0.

=======================
2. SPECIFICS OF IMPLEMENTATION

In order to interface with the bot, you will need to define a few things.

First, you will need to make a C++ file which includes some data from the bot.
This file should be placed in the src/modules/ directory.  You'll need to
include the bot information as such:

#include "modinclude.h"

This allows your class to extend the Module class and access other necessary
classes.

Second, you will need functions allowing the bot to load your module.  This is
internally known as "spawning," mostly because "spawn" is such a cool word.  In
order for the bot to load your module, you must define a way to load your
module.  A macro has been created to define this for you; all you need to do is
include the following at the very end of your module file:

MODULE_SPAWN(ModName)

You'll need to change ModName to the name of the class in your file that
extends Module and is to be the entry point for communication with the bot
core.

Now that you've defined those, you are ready to make your class!  Your class
must extend the Module class.

class ModName : public Module {
// Look!  A module!
};

You must define a constructor that calls the constructor for the parent Module
class; this allows the bot to load all the information it needs into the class
variables provided and loads your module with the appropriate information to
send data back to the bot core.  If this is not defined, your module will not
work correctly.

ModName(std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> modConf, Base* modFace, std::string modName, std::string dir, unsigned short debug) : Module(modConf, modFace, modName, dir, debug) {}

This is the base constructor that should be used.  You may, if you wish, add to
the constructor to initialize variables or do other things related to startup
of your module.  You should not start calling anything that interacts with the
rest of the bot until onLoadComplete() (see section 3.3, below).

Finally, the Module class contains a pure virtual function, botAPIversion().
This function must return an integer corresponding to the version of the bot
API with which your module complies.  Information about the current API version
is listed in section 1, above.

From here you have the skeleton of your module.  The rest of this document
outlines information you may want to know such as how to receive and be able to
parse data from IRC servers, and how to send data to IRC servers.

=======================
3. COMMUNICATING WITH A SERVER

As a module for an IRC bot, you can expect to be able to communicate with the
servers the bot is connected to.  The subsections that follow describe how to
catch received and sent data so that you can react to them as well as how to
send messages from your module.

=======================
3.1. RECEIVING DATA FROM A SERVER

One direction of communication is receiving data.  This is provided through
what the bot calls "hooks."  In order to use hooks you must simply define the
functions corresponding to the hooks you need, which are declared as virtual in
the base Module class.

bool onChannelMsg(std::string server, std::string client, std::string channel, char target, std::string nick, std::string message);
	This function is called when a message is sent to a channel.  The return value determines whether the hook loop will continue
		calling this hook to all modules; a return value of true means that it will, while a return value of false will stop the loop.
		Returning true results in normal behavior.

	client: The client which received it
	channel: The channel to which the message was sent

=======================
3.3. OTHER HOOKS

There are some other hooks, too.  When they are called depends on the hook.

Priority receivePriority();
	This function is called when the module is loaded and is used to determine the order in which module hooks are called.  This
		allows modules that do something requiring them to run either before or after other modules to specify that they should
		be executed in that order.  The valid priority values are, in order from first to last, PRI_HIGH, PRI_MEDIUM_HIGH, PRI_NORMAL,
		PRI_MEDIUM_LOW, and PRI_LOW.  PRI_NORMAL is the default if this function isn't redefined, and it should be used unless there
		is a reason not to do so.

bool onLoadComplete();
	This function is called when the module is done loading or after all the modules are done loading at startup.  This is where startup
		code should go.  It returns true if the load is successful and false if unsuccessful.  If false is returned, it is expected that the
		module called unloadModule().

void onRehash();
	This function is called when the bot is rehashed; this function should sync your module with any changes in the configuration, if applicable.

void onModuleChange();
	This function is called when another module is loaded or unloaded; it should be used to recheck any dependencies, if applicable.

void onPreConnect(std::string server);
	This function is called before the bot connects to a server.  It indicates that an entirely new server class is being created for a server
		not currently connected to by any bot clients.
	server: The server the bot is connecting to

void onConnect(std::string server, std::string client);
	This function is called when a new client connects to a server.  This always occurs after onPreConnect and may occur afterward as well.  It
		is called during user registration for clients or immediately after client introduction for servers.
	server: The server to which a client was connected
	client: The client that was connected

void onQuit(std::string server, std::string client);
	This function is called when a client quits from a server.
	server: The server from which a client quit
	client: The client that quit

std::string description();
	This function returns a brief description of the module.

std::vector<std::string> abilities();
	This function returns any abilities your module provides, allowing other modules to easily find modules that provide a certain service.

std::vector<std::string> supports();
	This function returns any abilities your module supports, allowing modules that provide services to be able to find your module if needed.

=======================
3.4. SENDING DATA TO A SERVER

Some functions are provided to you free of charge in the Module class allowing
you to easily perform certain actions.

=======================
5. INTERACTING WITH OTHER MODULES

Interacting with modules using functions that are not part of the Module class
requires the use of a custom class in a header file in the src/modules/ directory.
A module must extend the class in the header file in order to provide those
functions to other modules.  A module that takes advantage of another module's
functionality must have the header file present to compile, regardless of
whether the module that provides the functions your module is using is present
when the bot is run.

If your module constantly relies on the presence of another module, you should
check for the other module in both onLoadComplete() AND onModuleChange().
