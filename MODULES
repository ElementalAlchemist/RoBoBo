=======================
1. SPECIFICS OF IMPLEMENTATION

In order to interface with the bot, you will need to define a few things.

First, you will need to make a C++ file which includes some data from the bot.
This file should be placed in the modules/ directory.  The file should be
included as such:

#include "../robobo.h"

This allows your class to extend the Module class and access other necessary
classes.

Second, you will need functions allowing the bot to load your module.  This is
internally known as "spawning," mostly because "spawn" is such a cool word.  In
order for the bot to load your module, you must define a way to load your
module.  This is done most simply as such:

extern "C" Module* spawn() {
	return new mod_name;
}

In this portion, the only thing that should change is the returned class in the
spawn() function, which must be changed from mod_name to the name of your
module class.  This must be placed after your class definition.  If you think
you will forget about it, write it first, and then just define the class above
it.

Now that you've defined those, you are ready to make your class!  Your class
must extend the Module class.

class mod_name : public Module {
// Look!  A module!
};

Your constructor can be unique to your module.  The Module class has an empty
constructor with no important code in it (the important code is in a separate
function).  However, you should at least initialize the std::string variable
moduleName with the name of your module.

Finally, you should NOT overwrite the init() function.  This function is used
to pass important variables into the Module.

From here you have the skeleton of your module.  The rest of this document
outlines information you may want to know such as how to receive and be able to
parse data from IRC servers, and how to send data from IRC servers.

=======================
2. COMMUNICATING WITH A SERVER

As a module for an IRC bot, you can expect to be able to communicate with the
servers the bot is connected to.  The subsections that follow describe how to
catch received and sent messages so that you can react to them as well as how
to send messages from your module.

=======================
2.1. RECEIVING DATA FROM A SERVER

One direction of communication is receiving data.  This is provided through
what the bot calls "hooks."  In order to use hooks you must simply define the
functions corresponding to the hooks you need, which are declared in the base
Module class.

void onChannelMsg(std::string server, std::string channel, char target, std::string nick, std::string message);

=======================
2.2 RECEIVING DATA BEING SENT TO A SERVER

Some hooks are defined to catch outgoing data, as well.  These hooks will be
called when a matching line is sent, even if the hook being called belongs to
the module that sent the line.

=======================
3. HELPFUL VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS

The Module class contains some functions that make it possible to code many
modules and other functions that are just helpful.

std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> config;
This variable contains all of the variables that correspond to the module and
the values that the variables have as defined in the configuration file.

std::list<std::string> getServers()
This function returns a list of valid server names.  It gives the names of all
connected servers.

std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, Module*> getModules()
This function returns currently loaded modules.  This is useful if you want
your module to interact with another module.

std::vector<std::string> splitHostmask(std::string hostmask)
This function takes a hostmask.  The hostmask can be either in the form of a
normal nick!user@host hostmask or taken directly from a parsedLine[0] (or any
other variable that may contain a line split up in that fashion).
It returns a vector with the nick in position 0, the ident in position 1, and
the hostname in position 2.

std::vector<std::string> splitBySpace(std::string line)
This function takes any line, and it splits it into pieces using a space as a
delimiter.  Each word gets one position in the vector in the order in which the
word was found.
