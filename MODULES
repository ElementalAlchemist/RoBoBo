=======================
1. CURRENT API

The current API version is 1.1.0.

int ModuleClass::botAPIversion() {
	return 1100;
}

Module-breaking changes to the API are avoided starting with the release
candidate.  The API version in use as of 1.1.0RC1 was 1.1.0.

=======================
2. SPECIFICS OF IMPLEMENTATION

In order to interface with the bot, you will need to define a few things.

First, you will need to make a C++ file which includes some data from the bot.
This file should be placed in the src/modules/ directory.  You'll need to
include the bot information as such:

#include "modinclude.h"

This allows your class to extend the Module class and access other necessary
classes.

Second, you will need functions allowing the bot to load your module.  This is
internally known as "spawning," mostly because "spawn" is such a cool word.  In
order for the bot to load your module, you must define a way to load your
module.  This is done most simply as such:

extern "C" Module* spawn() {
	return new ModName;
}

In this snippet, the only thing that should change is the returned class in the
spawn() function, which must be changed from mod_name to the name of your
module class.  This must be placed after your class definition.  If you think
you will forget about it, write it first, and then just define the class above
it.

Now that you've defined those, you are ready to make your class!  Your class
must extend the Module class.

class ModName : public Module {
// Look!  A module!
};

If you wish you may write a constructor for your modules to initialize class
variables.  No parameters are passed to the constructor, and, as such, there is
not access to bot functions in the constructor.  Use onLoadComplete() instead
(see below, section 3.3), which the bot calls once your module has been loaded
(or if your module is loaded at startup, after all startup modules have been
loaded).

Finally, the Module class contains a pure virtual function, botAPIversion().
This function must return an integer corresponding to the version of the bot
API with which your module complies.  Information about the current API version
is listed in section 1, above.

From here you have the skeleton of your module.  The rest of this document
outlines information you may want to know such as how to receive and be able to
parse data from IRC servers, and how to send data to IRC servers.

=======================
3. COMMUNICATING WITH A SERVER

As a module for an IRC bot, you can expect to be able to communicate with the
servers the bot is connected to.  The subsections that follow describe how to
catch received and sent data so that you can react to them as well as how to
send messages from your module.

=======================
3.1. RECEIVING DATA FROM A SERVER

One direction of communication is receiving data.  This is provided through
what the bot calls "hooks."  In order to use hooks you must simply define the
functions corresponding to the hooks you need, which are declared as virtual in
the base Module class.

=======================
3.3. OTHER HOOKS

There are some other hooks, too.  When they are called depends on the hook.

bool onLoadComplete();
	This function is called when your module is loaded or, if the module is loaded during startup,
	after all the startup modules have been loaded.  You should return true unless during your
	checking in this function you determine that something is preventing your module from loading
	properly.  Note that returning false does not automatically unload your module.

void onRehash();
	This function is called whenever the bot is rehashed.  A new copy of the configuration data
	is loaded into each module before this function is called.

void onModuleChange();
	This function is called whenever a different module is loaded or unloaded.

void onPreConnect(std::string server);
	This function is called immediately before a bot connects to a server.

void onConnect(std::string server);
	This function is called when the bot connects to a server, immediately before the bot sends
	the registration information.

void onQuit (std::string server);
	This function is called whenever the bot quits or is removed from a server.

std::string description();
	This function allows you to provide a short description of your module.

std::vector<std::string> abilities();
	This function allows you to provide a list of abilities that your module provides (for example,
	the included admin module provides "BOT_ADMIN").  You can name your ability whatever you want, so
	long as it isn't the same as the name of another ability which does something different.  (Name
	conflicts may affect modules which use that ability.)

std::vector<std::string> supports();
	This function allows you to provide a list of abilities that your module uses/supports.  These may
	be required or optional dependencies.  This list typically helps modules providing each ability your
	module supports find your module.  This may or may not be required depending on the details of the
	ability.

4. HELPFUL VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS

The Module class contains some functions that make it possible to code many
modules and other functions that are just helpful.

std::string moduleName;
This variable contains the name for the module as known internally by the bot.
It's also the bot's filename.

unsigned short debugLevel;
The debug level the bot was started with.  This allows you to have your module
output debug info based on the debug level the bot was started with.

std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> config;
This variable contains all of the variables that correspond to the module and
the values that the variables have as defined in the configuration file.  The
map key is the specified variable, and the map value is the variable's
configured definition.

bool loadModule(std::string modName);
This function causes the bot to load the module with the filename modName and
call onModuleChange() for all loaded modules.

void unloadModule(std::string modName);
This function causes the bot to unload the module with the filename modName
and call onModuleChange() for all loaded modules.

void rehashBot();
This function causes the bot to reload the configuration file and call
onRehash() for all loaded modules.

unsigned int getBotVersion();
This function returns the version number of the bot core, in this format:
1001 = 1.0.1
1010 = 1.0.10
1102 = 1.1.2

std::list<std::string> getServers()
This function returns a list of valid server names.  It gives the names of all
connected servers.

std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, Module*> getModules()
This function returns currently loaded modules.  This is useful if you want
your module to interact with another module.

std::multimap<std::string, std::string> getModAbilities();
This function returns a list of module abilities.  This multimap works as
follows:
first = provided ability
second = module name

std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string> > getModSupports();
This function returns a list of abilities that modules support.  This unordered_map
works as follows:
first = ability
second = list of modules that support it

std::vector<std::string> splitHostmask(std::string hostmask)
This function takes a hostmask.  The hostmask can be either in the form of a
normal nick!user@host hostmask or taken directly from a parsedLine[0] (or any
other variable that may contain a line split up in that fashion).
It returns a vector with the nick in position 0, the ident in position 1, and
the hostname in position 2.

std::vector<std::string> splitBySpace(std::string line)
This function takes any line, and it splits it into pieces using a space as a
delimiter.  Each word gets one position in the vector in the order in which the
word was found.

std::string stripColors(std::string message)
This function takes any message from any user, and strips out any bold,
underline, and color codes (as well as the color parameters).

std::tr1::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> getServerData(std::string server);
This function returns the conf data held by the server class.  Any part of the
configuration may be updated by the Server class during normal use (such as
nick).

std::vector<std::vector<char> > getServerChanModes(std::string server);
This function returns all valid channel modes for the server as specified in
005 CHANMODES.  The outer vector has four elements, split by 005 CHANMODES's
commas:
0 => list modes
1 => modes that need a parameter to both set and unset (like +k)
2 => modes that take a parameter but do not require it to unset
3 => modes with no parameters
The inner vectors are as long as necessary to hold all the modes of that type.

std::vector<std::pair<char, char> > getServerPrefixes(std::string server);
This function returns all valid prefix/status modes for the server as specified
in 005 PREFIX.  Each entry holds two characters:
first => mode char
second => status prefix char
The modes are in order from 0 (highest precedence) to .size()-1 (lowest precedence).

std::list<std::string> getChannels(std::string server);
This function returns a list of the names of all the channels the bot is in on
the specified server.

std::string getChannelTopic(std::string server, std::string channel);
This function returns the topic of the specified channel on the specified
server, if the bot is in it.

std::list<std::string> getChannelUsers(std::string server, std::string channel);
This function returns a list of all users in the specified channel on the
specified server, if the bot is in it.

std::string getUserIdent(std::string server, std::string channel, std::string user);
This function returns the ident of the specified user.  Due to how the bot stores
user data, you'll need to supply a channel that both the bot and the user are in.

std::string getUserHost(std::string server, std::string channel, std::string user);
This function returns the host of the specified user.  Due to how the bot stores
user data, you'll need to specify a channel that both the bot and the user are in.

std::pair<char, char> getUserStatus(std::string server, std::string channel, std::string user);
This function returns the status of the specified user in the specified channel
on the specified server, if both the bot and the user are in that channel.  The
returned status is in this form:
first => mode char
second => status prefix char

=======================
5. INTERACTING WITH OTHER MODULES

Interacting with modules using functions that are not part of the Module class
requires the use of a custom class in a header file in the src/modules/ directory.
A module must extend the class in the header file in order to provide those
functions to other modules.  A module that takes advantage of another module's
functionality must have the header file present to compile, regardless of
whether the module that provides the functions your module is using is present
when the bot is run.

If your module relies on the presence of another module, you should check for
the other module in both onLoadComplete() AND onModuleChange().
