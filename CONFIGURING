The configuration is set up in a block format.  Each block is set up as such:

block_type block_name {
	var1 = "value 1";
	var2 = "value 2";
	var3 = "42";
	var4 = var1;
	var5 = var4 + var3;
	var6 = "not " + var2;
}

Currently there are only four block types.  These are as follows:
server - loads the configuration for the server and connects to it on startup
serverconf - loads the configuration for the server and saves it for later
	connection
module - loads the configuration for the module and loads it on startup
moduleconf - loads the configuration for the module and saves it for later
	loading

The end of the block type is signaled by any kind of whitespace.  After that,
you must specify the block name.
For server and serverconf, the block name is the address of the server, e.g.
	irc.example.net
For module and moduleconf, the block name is the filename of the module with
	the extension, e.g. m_example.so

The block name must be followed by an opening brace ({).
Inside the block, you can have any number of variables.  Variable names must be
separated from values by equal signs.  Values must be in quotes; RoBoBo will
assume anything not in quotes is a variable name from earlier in the block (and
if it's not, it'll be replaced with nothing).  You can append strings using the
plus (+) sign.  The strings can be literal strings that you put in the config
file (in quotes) or variable names from earlier in that block (not in quotes).
The plus sign does not add numbers if there are numbers in the string, but it
simply concatenates the strings.
In the example above, the following definitions are the same as the definitions
in the block:
var4 = "value 1";
var5 = "value 142";
var6 = "not value 1";
You can concatenate as many strings as you wish for one variable.

You must end each block with a closing brace (}).

If you wish, you may separate your config into different files and include each
one in robobo.conf.  The syntax for including is this:
include filename.conf;
Alternatively, you can keep configuration files elsewhere:
include /absolute/path/to/filename.conf;
include relative/path/to/filename.conf;

Relative paths are relative to the robobo executable.

If you wish to use different confs and load different ones at runtime, you can
do so using the --confdir and --confname options (you don't need to use both if
it's not necessary).
--confdir <directory> allows you to specify a directory to look in for the
config file.  If not specified, RoBoBo looks in the main robobo dir.
--confname <directory> allows you to specify a different filename for the
config file.  If not specified, RoBoBo looks for robobo.conf.
